1. Introduction and Problem Statement

The modern academic environment presents unique and escalating challenges for students, leading to increased levels of stress, anxiety, and burnout. While many factors contribute to this (academic load, social pressure, financial concerns), tracking and understanding the specific, quantifiable inputs is crucial for effective intervention.

The goal of the Student Stress Tracker is to provide students and educational institutions with a data-driven tool to monitor, visualize, and identify the key drivers of stress over time. This shifts the focus from reactive mental health care to proactive stress management.

 2. Project Goals

 Primary Goals
Stress Quantification: To develop a system that accurately translates daily activities and subjective experiences into a quantifiable, trackable stress score.
Pattern Identification:To identify longitudinal patterns, triggers, and correlations between lifestyle factors (sleep, exercise, diet) and fluctuations in stress levels.
Proactive Insights:To generate timely alerts or summary reports that highlight periods of high risk for burnout or severe stress.

Secondary Goals
* Feature Importance: To determine which recorded features (e.g., hours of sleep vs. hours of study) are the most significant predictors of high-stress events.
* Personalized Feedback: To provide users with personalized, data-backed recommendations for stress reduction (e.g., "Your stress peaked on days with $<6$ hours of sleep; prioritize sleep this week").

3. Core Functionality and Features

The application will incorporate the following main components:

| Feature Area |                         | Description |                                                           |  Input/Output |

| Daily Logging Module| A user-friendly interface for students to quickly log daily metrics. | Inputs: Sleep hours, study hours, exercise time, social activity level, subjective mood score (1-10), qualitative notes. |
| Stress Calculation Engine | A proprietary or machine learning-driven model that processes logged data and outputs a normalized stress score. | Output:Daily Stress Index (0-100). |
| Data Visualization Dashboard| An interactive dashboard showing stress trends over days, weeks, and months. | Visuals: Line graphs of Stress Index, bar charts comparing sleep vs. stress, heatmaps showing trigger days. |
| Alert and Reporting System| Automated notifications based on predefined high-stress thresholds. | Alerts: "Stress Index is in the critical zone (>$75$). Review your recent sleep and study patterns." |
| Historical Data Analysis | Functionality to review and export personal data for sharing with counselors or personal reflection. | Reports:Summary statistics, key correlations (e.g., lowest stress days). |

4. Target Audience

1.  Students (Primary Users): Individuals seeking to understand their own stress patterns and make lifestyle adjustments.
2.  University/School Counselors:Professionals who can use the anonymized, aggregated data (or individual data with consent) to identify student populations most at risk and tailor counseling strategies.
3.  Researchers: Academics interested in studying the relationship between digital activity, health metrics, and mental well-being in the student demographic.

 5. Success Metrics

The success of the Student Stress Tracker will be measured by:

* User Engagement Rate:Consistent daily logging by at least 50% of active users over a 30-day period.
* Stress Awareness: A measurable increase in the correlation between a user's perceived stress and the application's calculated Stress Index score.
* Utility & Impact: Positive qualitative feedback from users indicating that the insights provided led to actionable changes (e.g., improved sleep hygiene, reduced study overload).
